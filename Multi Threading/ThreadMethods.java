Methods of Thread class:

void run():                     is used to perform action for a thread.
void start():                   starts the execution of the thread.JVM calls the run() method on the thread.
void sleep(long miliseconds):   Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease execution) for the specified number of milliseconds.
void join():                    waits for a thread to die.
void join(long miliseconds):    waits for a thread to die for the specified miliseconds.
int getPriority():              returns the priority of the thread.
int setPriority(int priority):  changes the priority of the thread.
String getName():               returns the name of the thread.
void setName(String name):      changes the name of the thread.
Thread currentThread():         returns the reference of currently executing thread.
int getId():                    returns the id of the thread. // depriciated after java 19
int threadId():                 returns the id of the thread. 
Thread.State getState():        returns the state of the thread.
boolean isAlive():              tests if the thread is alive.
void yield():                   causes the currently executing thread object to temporarily pause and allow other threads to execute.
void suspend():                 is used to suspend the thread(depricated).
void resume():                  is used to resume the suspended thread(depricated).
void stop():                    is used to stop the thread(depricated).
boolean isDaemon():             tests if the thread is a daemon thread.
void setDaemon(boolean b):      marks the thread as daemon or user thread.
void interrupt():               interrupts the thread.
boolean isInterrupted():        tests if the thread has been interrupted.
static boolean interrupted():   tests if the current thread has been interrupted.
String toString():              Returns a string representation of this thread, including the threadâ€™s name, priority, and thread group

Thread[#22,Thread-0,5,main] : 
22 => Thread ID
Thread-0 => Name of the thread (default name)
5 => Priority of the thread (default priority)
main => Thread group


- If the priority <1 or >10 then it will throw IllegalArgumentException
- IllegalArgumentException is a subclass of RuntimeException class and categorized as Unchecked Exception
- If start() is invoked multiple times by the same thread class object then it throws "IllegalThreadStateException"
